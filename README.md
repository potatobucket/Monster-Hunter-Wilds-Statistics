# Monster Hunter Wilds Statistics

## Introduction
The purpose of this study is to analyze my performance in the video game *Monster Hunter Wilds* using hunt times as the main metric.

The data has been gathered by me playing the game as I normally would:
 - SOS flares automatically deployed
	 + including Support Hunters and other human-controlled hunters
 - playing with friends (in which case SOS flares are disabled)
 - palicos hunt with me when available

and compiled into a CSV file with Google Sheets.
 
### Known shortcomings
 - small data pool
	 + only tracking my own hunts
	 + can only do so many hunts per day
 - uneven distribution of monster hunts
